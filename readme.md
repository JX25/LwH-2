A Blending Problem - Logistyka w Hutnictwie projekt #2

The metal blending example involves mixing some metals to form an alloy. The metal may come from several sources: in pure form, from raw materials, as scraps from previous mixes, or as ingots. The alloy must contain certain amounts of the various metals, as expressed by a production constraint specifying lower and upper bounds for the quantity of each metal in the alloy. Each source has a cost and the problem consists of blending from the sources while minimizing the cost and satisfying the production constraint. Similar problems arise in other domains, for example, the oil, paint, and food-processing industries.
